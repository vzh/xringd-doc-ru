"The xringd Linux extended Ring server will listen on a modem device for "
"specific ring-delay patterns (sequences). Each sequence, when fully "
"recognised, will execute a command you have chosen (subject to usual unix "
"permissions). Delays are in fact delay ranges. Sequences and commands are "
"read from a a configuration file.  I<xringd> does not disturb your other "
"modem programs, not even your getty. It coexists with them.  I<xringd> "
